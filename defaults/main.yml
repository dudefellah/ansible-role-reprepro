# defaults file for ansible-role-reprepro

# This values lists packages to be installed when using this role. If
# left `null`, this role tries to install what it thinks is appropriate
# (which basically amounts to installing the `reprepro` pkg in this case).
#
# If you set this to a custom list, those packages will be installed. An empty
# list will prevent any packages from being installed by this role.
reprepro_packages: null

# Set to true to have this role install the epel-release on RHEL systems.
# Just here as a convenience.
reprepro_rhel_install_epel: false

# These values determine the user and groups who will own the files installed
# by this role.

# This is a list of distrobutions to add to your config/distributions
# Each entry in the list is a yaml-ified version of what appears in the
# `distributions` file. Generally, this just means the dict keys are all
# lower-case.
# Eg.
#   - origin: Project name
#     label: Project label
#     codename: <release>
#     architectures: i386 amd64 ... (or ['i386', 'amd64'...])
#     components: main ... (or ['main', 'contrib'...])
#     description: My apt repo
#     sign_with: <key>
reprepro_distributions_config: []

# Each entry in this list will be added as a line to conf/optinos.
# Eg.
#   - verbose
#   - basedir /srv/repos/apt/debian
#   - ask-passphrase
reprepro_options_config: []

# This dict is keyed by package names. Each package entry has a list
# of override values in the form of entries with {name: <name>, value: <value>}
# entries.
#
# Eg.
#   gcc:
#     - name: Priority
#       value: required
#   nginx:
#     - name: Section
#       value: net
reprepro_overrides_config: {}

# A list of public keys to make available in your reprepro repo path.
# Each entry has a name and content OR src (src takes priority).
# `name` sets the name of the file to be written (minus the .gpg.key extension).
# If `content` is set, then that will be written to the file.
# If `src` is set, then that file will be copied to the destination path.
# If 'dest' is set, that path will be used to deposit the GPG key. If unset, the
# file will be placed at `{{ reprepro_base_dir }}/conf/{{ name }}.gpg.key`
#
# Eg.
#   - name: mykey
#     src: mykey.gpg
#
#  or
#
#   - name: mykey
#     content: |
